    <p class="biography">Q is a gray tabby cat. She was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, but now lives in Lawrence, Kansas. This makes her a well traveled cat! She loves catnip, lunchmeat, and tuna. In her free time (which is all the time) she enjoys laying in sunspots, playing with her vast collection of toys and picking on her brother (the dog).</p>
